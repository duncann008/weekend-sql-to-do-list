To-Do App

## How I Approached My Project

1. Created the appropriate folders to store the files I will need to create.
    - Server, Public, Scripts, Routers, Styles

2. Created all the files needed for my project.
    - HTML, CSS, JS(Server, Router, and Client), jQuery, .gitignore, database.sql

3. Brought in the modules I'd need.
    - NPM, Express, pg
    - Added npm start script to start my server.

4. Made sure that all of my files are working together.
    - Brought in my jQuery file.
    - Added boilerplate HTML to source my files.
    - Sourced my client.js, styles.css, and jQuery.js into my index.html.
    - Got jQuery working with my client with an onReady function.

5. Created a database on Postico to work with my app demands.
    - Created a table with "id", "task", and "complete".
    - Added some dummy data to better visualize and test my table while I work with it.
    - Put the sql-query stuff into my database.sql.
